    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>1. Choose the month, day of your trip and the number of nights. Remember that you need to have 24-hour
        flexibility for before or after the round trip days.</p>
    <p>2. After the purchase, within 20 days, we will send you a form by e-mail to fill in the passenger data, as well
        as any observations. If you do not receive the form within 20 days of purchase, it is the customer's
        responsibility to contact 123Milhas to request a new shipment.</p>
    <p>3. Up to 10 days before your chosen date, we will send you all documentation with your travel details. Now just
        pack your bags and start the countdown to fun!</p>
